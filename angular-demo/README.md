# What is Angular?

Angular is a popular open-source web application framework primarily maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations. It is used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for developing complex web applications with ease. Angular is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, which adds type checking and other features to JavaScript.

Key features and components of Angular include:

1. **Components:** Angular applications are built using components, which are reusable and self-contained building blocks for defining the user interface and behavior of different parts of a web application.

2. **Templates:** Angular uses HTML templates with additional syntax and features to define the structure and presentation of the user interface. These templates are extended with Angular-specific directives and bindings to create dynamic views.

3. **Data Binding:** Angular offers two-way data binding, which allows for automatic synchronization between the model (application data) and the view (UI). Changes in one are reflected in the other without the need for explicit DOM manipulation.

4. **Dependency Injection:** Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that helps manage the creation and sharing of application components, making it easier to develop and test individual parts of the application in isolation.

5. **Routing:** Angular provides a powerful routing module for managing navigation within the application. It allows developers to define routes, route parameters, and navigate between different views or components.

6. **HTTP Client:** Angular includes an HTTP client module for making HTTP requests to APIs and servers, simplifying data retrieval and manipulation.

7. **Forms:** Angular provides robust support for building forms, including template-driven forms and reactive forms. These forms can handle user input, validation, and submission.

8. **Directives:** Angular's custom directives extend HTML with additional functionality. You can use built-in directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitch, or create your own custom directives.

9. **Services:** Angular encourages the use of services to encapsulate and share logic and data across components. Services are typically used for tasks like data retrieval, authentication, and other business logic.

10. **Testing:** Angular is designed with testing in mind and provides tools and utilities for unit testing and end-to-end testing of applications.

Angular has evolved over the years, with major version updates that introduce new features and improvements. It's important to note that there is another framework called AngularJS (or simply Angular 1), which is a completely different framework from Angular. AngularJS is the older version and is no longer actively maintained, so it's essential to use the correct terminology when referring to Angular (commonly referred to as Angular 2+ or just Angular).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
